# Sliding Window Technique

Sliding Window problems involve moving a fixed or variable-size window through a data structure,

typically an array or string,

to solve problems efficiently based on continuous subsets of elements.

This technique is used when we need to find **subarrays** or **substrings** according to a given set of conditions.
