# Time Complexity of the Given Code
The given Java code snippet has the following structure:

```java
public class Time_Complexity {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 10;
        int c = a + b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```

Time Complexity Analysis
The operations in the given code are constant time operations:

Variable Initialization: `int a = 10;`, `int b = 10;`, and `int c = a + b;` are all constant time operations, 
O(1).
<br>
Print Statement: `System.out.println(c);` is also a constant time operation, 
O(1).
\\
Since there are no loops or recursive calls, the overall time complexity of this code is 
O(1).
